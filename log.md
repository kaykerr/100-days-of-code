<!--**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.-->

### Day 1: December 10, 2019- Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm finally figuring out GitHub!

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding and I have been trying to wrap my head around how GitHub actually works. I watched some tutorials from a front-end class I took in college, worked through some of the GitHub Learning Lab tutorials, and got a lot of my questions answered via Twitter.

### Day 2: December 11, 2019- Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Javascript finally

**Thoughts** While I have tried my hand at Javascript before (front-end class), the language has never really made sense to me. Because of this, I have been putting off learning Javascript and have instead been playing around with CSS (which is my favorite, it's where I get to design and make things look good). I finally took the plunge today and started Colt Steele and Stephen Grider's course on Udemy called *The New Modern Javascript Bootcamp (2020)*. So far, everything (except NaN and -0... what the heck is up with that??) is making a lot more sense so I am hopeful that their teaching style is right for me!
