### Day 1: December 10 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm finally figuring out GitHub!

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding and I have been trying to wrap my head around how GitHub actually works. I watched some tutorials from a front-end class I took in college, worked through some of the GitHub Learning Lab tutorials, and got a lot of my questions answered via Twitter.
